##  Project Overview

This system is designed for **secure health data management** using **Blockchain technology**.  
It enables two types of users:

- **Admin** (verified health personnel) — Upload and manage health records.  
- **User/Patient** — Access personal health records after Aadhaar verification.

Data is uploaded to **IPFS** and its **hash** is stored on the **Ethereum blockchain (Sepolia Testnet)** through **MetaMask** transactions.  
This ensures **immutability, transparency, and privacy**.
